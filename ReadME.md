Overview:
Follow Rhythm is a 2D rhythm game, where players need to use XBOX controller to hit music notes at correct timing of beats of a song to gain high scores. Two kinds of notes would be supported: single note (LB/RB button click) and consecutive notes (left/right joysticks moving up and down). Notes would come from both sides of screen. Player would be able to choose the song the play, and the more correct the timing of notes hitting is, the more scores player would get. The game would also support highest score recordings of each song. 
The notes moving method resembles to “TERRORHYTHM (TRRT) - Rhythm driven action beat 'em up!” , where left hands should be responsible for notes coming from left side of screen, and right hands responsible for right side. The consecutive notes would resemble “Rhythm Master” . 
Notes of songs would be manually marked through Audition and translated to wanted format. And the game should be navigated only through gamepad.
